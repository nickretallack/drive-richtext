# Todo List

- [ ] Write tests using qunit and a local realtime api document, subscribing to local events
- [ ] Fix some off-by-one errors and ensure all indexReferences refer to just before the character with the same index 
- [ ] Support "embeds" in addition to "overlays". They're like overlays, but only have a start index, and always decorate a single space character
- [ ] Make formatText work without assumption that quill will always give well-formed mutations that don't format any of an already-formatted area
- [ ] Support the whole Quill toolbar
- [ ] Support the Authorship and Author Cursors quill modules
- [ ] Support a rich text editor other than Quill
